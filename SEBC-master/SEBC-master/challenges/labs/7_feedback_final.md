Tp be honest, all topics are not familiar for me. Though I have tried installing EC2 instances, but its with free tier.

On an administrator side, not me though, all topics I think are helpful in engaging future clients.

How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
I think I need to have basic courses for this matter before I could finally prepare myself on thw workloads aside from being a Data Scientst
